1. Intended platform for final project (e.g. Android, iOS): Android
2. Intended framework/programming language for your final project (e.g. Kotlin, Swift): Kotlin
3. Whether you want to explore cross-platform development: Yes, maybe
4. Include a brief explanation for your selections: 
   I will be starting a course on Flutter online to learn and create a Flutter app, but if the final project becomes too difficult to create using Flutter, I will switch to simple Android App Development using Kotlin language.
   I have chosen Android as my primary platform for the final project as I have a Windows laptop and an Android phone.
